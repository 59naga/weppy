DEMO (Fx4.0 + Chr + Op 10.6): http://antimatter15.github.com/weppy/demo.html

=== How does it work? ===

WebP is actually a lightweight container for a single VP8 frame (whereas WebM is a container based off Matroska meant for video). WebM support exists already in Chrome, Firefox and Opera, so all that's needed to render it is to do a little magic to convert the RIFF encoded WebP image into a EBML/Matroska encoded single frame WebM video, loading it in a <video> and replacing the .webp image with the <video> element.


=== What Browsers? ===

Chrome 7.0, Opera 10.62, and Firefox 4.0 were tested and functional. It should work in all browsers that support WebM video.
