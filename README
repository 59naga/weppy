What does this library do?

It should allow the rendering of WebP images in all browsers that support WebM video.

How does it work?

WebP is actually a lightweight container for a single VP8 frame (whereas WebM is a container based off Matroska meant for video). WebM support exists already in Chrome, Firefox and Opera, so all that's needed to render it is to do a little magic to convert the RIFF encoded WebP image into a EBML/Matroska encoded single frame WebM video, loading it in a <video>, using drawImage() on a <canvas> and replacing the .webp image with the data URL extracted from the <canvas> using getDataURL().
